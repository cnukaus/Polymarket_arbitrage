Enhanced Query Generation Strategies

  7 Different Strategies (ordered by confidence):

  1. Original Pattern (90% confidence) - Preserves the existing "Will X win Y" logic for backward compatibility
  2. Direct Name (80% confidence) - Uses contract name directly when it matches market name
  3. Constructed Win (75% confidence) - Builds "Will X win Y" from extracted key terms
  4. Election Patterns (70-55% confidence) - Multiple election-specific formats
  5. Fuzzy Reconstruction (65% confidence) - Combines key terms from both contract and market names
  6. Simple Election (60% confidence) - Falls back to "Candidate election" format
  7. Similarity Bridge (55% confidence) - Handles very different names with simple "Will X win" format

  Key Improvements

  - Confidence Scoring: Each query gets a confidence score that combines strategy reliability with match success
  - Fuzzy Matching: Uses text normalization, key term extraction, and similarity scoring
  - Fallback Methods: Multiple strategies ensure better coverage of different naming patterns
  - Detailed Logging: Shows which strategy worked and confidence levels for debugging
  - Enhanced Output: Displays match confidence and strategy used in arbitrage reports

  Text Processing Features

  - Normalization: Removes special characters, handles spacing and case
  - Key Term Extraction: Identifies important political/election terms
  - Similarity Analysis: Uses SequenceMatcher to detect very different names and bridge them

  The enhanced version maintains backward compatibility while dramatically improving match rates for markets that don't follow the rigid "Will X win Y" pattern. It should handle diverse naming conventions
  much more effectively while providing transparency about match quality through confidence scoring.
