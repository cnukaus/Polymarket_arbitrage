● Great! The dataclass error is now fixed. The code ran without any Python syntax errors. Now let me provide the enrichment suggestions using the subgraph analytics. Based on my analysis of the
  polymarket-subgraph-analytics repository, here are the key integration opportunities:

  Priority 1: Core Integrations

  1. Polymarket Names Subgraph - Human-readable market titles

  - Integration point: connectors.py PolymarketConnector
  - Value: Convert questionIDs to readable market descriptions for better matching
  - Method: Query names subgraph in parallel with market data fetching

  2. Orderbook Subgraph - Real-time liquidity and pricing

  - Integration point: arbitrage_engine.py for slippage calculation
  - Value: Real-time bid-ask spreads, market depth, liquidity scoring
  - Methods: orderBooks, spreads, marketDepths, orderFlow queries

  Priority 2: Enhanced Analytics


  4. Activity Subgraph - Market lifecycle tracking

  - Integration point: Event timeline analysis
  - Value: Split/merge activities, resolution events
  - Usage: Avoid markets with unusual activity patterns

  Priority 3: Advanced Features

  5. Open Interest Subgraph - Market sizing

  - Integration point: Risk management in arbitrage detection
  - Value: Track open positions and market size
  - Usage: Size arbitrage opportunities appropriately

  6. PnL Subgraph - User performance tracking

  - Integration point: Strategy backtesting and validation
  - Value: Historical performance data for market makers
  - Usage: Identify profitable venues and timing patterns

  Specific Enhancement Methods

  From the subgraph analytics, these query patterns would be most valuable:

  1. Cross-subgraph market enrichment (Names + Main + Orderbook)
  2. Real-time spread monitoring for arbitrage timing
  3. Market depth analysis for slippage calculation
  4. Volume-based market filtering to focus on liquid opportunities
  5. Creator analytics to identify high-quality market makers

  The most immediate value would come from integrating the Names and Orderbook subgraphs to enhance market matching accuracy and improve arbitrage calculation precision.


. Advanced Market Discovery & Enrichment

  From: polymarket-names.md and polymarket-main.md

  Use in our project:
  # In connectors.py - PolymarketConnector
  async def fetch_enriched_markets(self) -> List[Dict]:
      """Fetch markets with human-readable names and volume data"""

      # Query 1: Get market metadata from Names subgraph
      names_query = """
      {
        markets(first: 100, orderBy: timestamp, orderDirection: desc) {
          questionID
          question  # Human-readable title
          creator
          timestamp
        }
      }
      """

      # Query 2: Get trading data from Main subgraph
      main_query = """
      {
        fixedProductMarketMakers(
          first: 100, 
          orderBy: scaledCollateralVolume, 
          orderDirection: desc
        ) {
          id
          conditions
          scaledCollateralVolume
          outcomeTokenPrices
          tradesQuantity
          creationTimestamp
        }
      }
      """

      # Combine both datasets for enriched market data

  Benefits: Transform cryptic IDs into readable market descriptions, essential for our event matching.

  2. Real-time Orderbook & Liquidity Analysis

  From: polymarket-orderbook.md

  Use in our arbitrage engine:
  # In arbitrage_engine.py - Enhanced slippage estimation
  async def get_market_liquidity_data(self, market_id: str) -> Dict:
      """Get real-time orderbook depth for accurate slippage estimation"""

      orderbook_query = """
      {
        orderBooks(where: { marketId: "MARKET_ID" }) {
          bestBid
          bestAsk
          totalBidDepth
          totalAskDepth
          spreadPercentage
        }
        marketDepths(where: { marketId: "MARKET_ID" }) {
          depthAt1Percent
          depthAt5Percent
          depthAt10Percent
          bidLiquidity
          askLiquidity
        }
      }
      """

  def _estimate_slippage_advanced(self, contract_side: ContractSide, position_size: Decimal) -> Decimal:
      """Use real orderbook data for precise slippage calculation"""
      # Replace crude estimates with actual depth analysis
      # Factor in bid-ask spreads and depth at price levels

  Benefits: Replace guesswork with actual liquidity data for accurate arbitrage profit calculations.

  3. Market Flow & Sentiment Analysis

  From: polymarket-orderbook.md - Order Flow section

  Use in our event matcher:
  # In event_matcher.py - Enhanced matching with market sentiment
  async def get_market_sentiment_signals(self, market_id: str) -> Dict:
      """Analyze order flow for market sentiment and momentum"""

      flow_query = """
      {
        orderFlows(where: { marketId: "MARKET_ID" }) {
          buyFlow
          sellFlow
          orderFlowImbalance
          buySellRatio
          flow1Min
          flow5Min
          flow15Min
        }
      }
      """

      # Use flow imbalance as additional matching signal
      # Markets with similar flow patterns might be related

  Benefits: Add momentum/sentiment as additional signal for cross-venue event matching.

  4. Historical Trading Pattern Analysis

  From: polymarket-main.md and polymarket-orderbook.md

  Use for market validation:
  # In event_model.py - EventNormalizer
  async def validate_market_with_history(self, event: Event) -> Event:
      """Enrich event with historical trading patterns"""

      history_query = """
      {
        orderFills(
          where: { marketId: "MARKET_ID" }
          orderBy: timestamp
          orderDirection: desc
          first: 100
        ) {
          price
          size
          timestamp
          maker
          taker
        }
      }
      """

      # Add trading volume, price volatility, participant count as metadata
      # Use for confidence scoring in cross-venue matching

  Benefits: Better match validation using historical activity patterns.

  5. Cross-Market Analytics Dashboard

  From: Multi-subgraph integration examples in README

  Implementation:
  # New file: market_analytics.py
  class PolymarketAnalytics:
      """Advanced analytics combining multiple subgraphs"""

      async def get_comprehensive_market_data(self, market_ids: List[str]) -> List[Dict]:
          """Combine data from all 6 subgraphs for complete market picture"""

          # Names: Human-readable titles
          # Main: Volume and price data  
          # Orderbook: Real-time liquidity
          # Activity: Split/merge operations
          # Open Interest: Position tracking
          # PnL: Profitability metrics

          return enriched_markets

      async def detect_arbitrage_with_full_context(self, matches: List[MatchResult]) -> List[ArbitrageOpportunity]:
          """Enhanced arbitrage detection with complete market context"""
          # Factor in:
          # - Real-time spreads
          # - Actual liquidity depth  
          # - Trading momentum
          # - Historical volatility
          # - Position concentration

      def __init__(self):
          self.subgraphs = {
              'names': 'QmP6hMoYTYx4dFGs2dYiNnUDsRZ4ybhH9N6C6G19tHQxku',

          }

      async def fetch_multi_subgraph_data(self, market_ids: List[str]) -> Dict:
          """Orchestrate queries across multiple subgraphs"""
          # Parallel queries to all relevant subgraphs
          # Combine results into enriched market dataset

  Result: Transform from basic arbitrage detection to comprehensive market intelligence system with real-time liquidity analysis, sentiment tracking, and precise profit calculations.
